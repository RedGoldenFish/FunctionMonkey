# Compiling Function Monkey

You will need the yarn package manager to build Function Monkey (it includes the Swagger UI distribution package) so if you don't have that install it from here:

    https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/

Next clone the source code from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/cgoconseils/FunctionMonkey.git

Next in Visual Studio (or Code) open the solution file _FunctionMonkey.sln_.

Then build... that should be it!
